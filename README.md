# SQLite3 Bindings for Rust

[<img src="https://travis-ci.org/kud1ing/rustsqlite.png?branch=master">](https://travis-ci.org/kud1ing/rustsqlite)

To compile use `rustc src/sqlite3.rs` or if you have Cargo installed `cargo build`.

The interface is currently evolving both along with Rust and as I think of
better ways to implement various behaviors. If you have ideas about better
behavior for anything in this binding please feel free to open an issue.
